                    <strong>Published January 2020</strong>
                    <p>One of the biggest questions scientists will always have and can not be certain about is whether there is life outside of our own planet. There is so much out there that we are not able to see yet, but hopefully we will be able to one day. Besides our own galaxy, there are... </p>

                    <p>A huge part of discoveries, unlocking more doors and gathering new information comes from experimenting. One of the next experiments or "phases" in NASA's plans is the use of atomic clocks for space missions. NASA has already sent out... </p>

                    <p>A black hole is a region in space that has characteristics that can seem very bizarre and unreal. They are extremely dense, and they have a gravitational acceleration that is so strong that nothing can escape from it when caught. Not even light, which can travel...</p>

                    <strong>Published December 2019</strong>
                    <p>One of the questions that scientists have always wondered about is the size and age of the universe. Whether the universe was infinite in size, or does it stop at some point, and the things that would occur if there was an "end". In the early 1800's, there was a...</p>

                    <p>A galaxy is a vast system containing stars, planets, nebulae, dust, gas, and dark matter that are held together by gravity. In the middle of the galaxy, there is a supermassive black hole that keeps everything bound together. There are... </p>

                    <p>Stars are large sphere-like bodies made of plasma, mainly consisting of hydrogen and helium. The process in which stars fuse hydrogen in their cores releases energy, radiating heat and light to space. The closest star to Earth is the Sun, which is...</p>

                    <p>Asteroids are small bodies of rock or metal that orbit the Sun. There are hundreds of thousands of asteroids in our solar system that we know about, and quite possibly much more that are roaming the galaxy. Asteroids can range in size significantly...</p>

                    <p>The future is something that can't be predicted with absolute certainty. There are scientific theories that may accurately predict what might possibly occur in the future, but as with anything, events in the future can't be guaranteed. Regardless, scientists have...</p>
