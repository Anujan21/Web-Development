                <h4>Mercury</h4> 
                <p>Mercury is the first of the four inner planets, and the closest planet to the Sun. It is also the smallest of the eight planets that are in the Milky Way galaxy. It has a rocky surface and an iron core. The iron core in Mercury is very large compared to other rocky planets like Earth and Mars. This makes Mercury's mass very high compared to its size. Mercury lies about a distance of 36 million miles from the sun, which may sound like a lot, but it is 2.5 times closer than our Earth is to the Sun. Despite being further from the Sun, Venus experiences higher temperatures. The surface of Mercury which faces the Sun sees temperatures of up to 427°C, whilst on the alternate side this can be as low as -173°C. This is due to the planet having no atmosphere to help regulate the temperature. Mercury is tough to study from Earth because it is inside the Earth's orbit. This means that when you try to look at Mercury, you are also looking at the Sun. The bright light of the Sun makes it nearly impossible to see Mercury. Because of this Mercury is best seen right after the Sun sets or just before it rises.

                <h4>Venus</h4>
                <p>Venus is the second of the four inner planets, which makes it the second closest to the Sun. A day on Venus takes 117 Earth days, meaning it revolves around much slower than Earth. Venus is similar to Earth in a lot of ways, especially in size. Venus and Earth only have a 638 km difference in diameter, and Venus is also 81.5% of Earths mass. They both have a central core, a molten mantle and a crust. An interesting fact to know about Venus is that The atmospheric pressure on the surface of the planet is 92 times that of Earth's. Like Mars, Venus also has a rocky surface and has geographical features similar to Earth like mountains, valleys and volcanoes. But the volcanoes on Venus are everywhere, and can be more than 100km long.

                <h4>Earth</h4>
                <p>Earth is the third of the four inner planets, and the third closest to the Sun. It is the largest of the terrestrial planets. Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and it is the only known planet to support life. The Earth is covered 70% by water, and currently has 7 main large land masses - otherwise known as the continents. Earth is the only planet that has water in liquid form on it's surface. Also, the Earth's atmosphere is made up of mostly nitrogen and oxygen while Venus' and Mars' atmospheres are made up mostly of carbon dioxide. The layers of Earth can be categorized into 4 layers, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. An interest fact to note is that the Earth orbits the Sun at a speed of 67,000 miles per hour. Long ago, ancient scientists used to believe that the Earth was the centre of the universe, and the moon and Sun and everything else used to revolve around the Earth. This idea was then corrected many years down the line. The Earth also has a very powerful magnetic field. This is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This magnetic field protects the Earth from the effects of the solar wind.

                <h4>Mars</h4>
                <p>Mars is the fourth of the 4 terrestrial planets, meaning it's the 4th closest to the Sun. It is also the second smallest planet in our Solar System, after Mercury. Mars has a thin atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide. Mars surface is dry and is covered with a reddish layer of dust and rocks. Mars tend to have huge dust storms with high speed winds that are powered by the Sun that can sometimes be so great that it can be seen from Earth. Mars is also another planet that is very Similar to Earth in many ways, having a lot of the geological structures and objects that you find here on earth such as mountains and volcanoes. There is also evidence that water in its liquid state could have existed on the surface of Mars like Earth. Some people believe that if the Earth becomes inhabitable in the next century, that we will eventually move to Mars and colonize the planet in order to keep humans alive. There still needs to be a lot of work done in that regard before that happens, as the atmosphere is an issue on Mars that needs to be changed before humans can step foot on the planet.

                <h4>Jupiter</h4>
                <p>Jupiter is the 5th closest planet to the Sun, and the first of the gas giant planets. The reason its called a gas giant is because its surface is made up of a thick layer of hydrogen gas. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System and the fourth brightest object in the solar system. In fact, you can see Jupiter with the naked eye from Earth at times without a telescope. Jupiter has the shortest day out of all the planets. One day on Jupiter is equal just under 10 hours on Earth. Jupiter has 79 moons orbiting the planet, and one of its moons, Ganymede, is the largest moon in the solar system who's size is even bigger than Mercury. Jupiter is much different than how Earth is. Since it is a gas giant, the surface is gas, so there would be no place to stand even if you wanted to. Jupiter is also known for its Great Red Spot. This spot is where Jupiter has raging storms that go on for hundreds of years and are so violent that it could destroy the Earth. The storm is large enough for 3 Earths to fit inside the area.

                <h4>Saturn</h4>
                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is the second largest planet in our solar system. It is commonly known for its outer ring system. Saturn is a gas giant and composed of similar gases to Jupiter including hydrogen, helium and methane. Saturn is the flattest planet due to its low density and fast rotation. Saturn turns on its axis once every 10 hours and 34 minutes and orbits the Sun once every 29.4 Earth years. Saturn has 82 moons, more moons than any other planet. The surface of Saturn is gaseous but deeper within the planet the hydrogen becomes liquid and then metal, resulting in a hard rocky core. Saturn is the least dense planet in the solar system and is even less dense than water, meaning it would float on water. Saturn's rings are made up of mainly ice particles with some dust and rocks, and are located around Saturn's equator. Saturn has seven rings stretching out more than 120 700 km from the planet, while each ring is only about 20 meters thick.

                <h4>Uranus</h4>
                <p>Uranus is the 7th planet from the Sun, and it is the 3rd of the gas giant planets. Not only is it a gas giant, but its also known as the ice giant planet. That is because its surface is a gas, but the interior is made up of rocks and ice. This makes Uranus have the coldest atmosphere out of all the planets in the solar system. While the atmosphere on Uranus is also stormy, it is not as stormy as the atmospheres on Saturn and Jupiter. One of Uranus's unique features is that it rotates on its side, opposite to how the other planets would rotate. Scientists believe that this is because Uranus could have been hit by a large enough object in space to have forced it to change its rotational axis. This odd rotational axis makes parts of Uranus have light from the Sun for 42 years, and then be dark for 42 years. Uranus also has rings like Saturn, but they are thinner and darker. Uranus has 27 moons that revolve around it, and there has only been one ever spacecraft that has flown by Uranus, to capture images of the planet, its moons and rings.

                <h4>Neptune</h4>
                <p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the most distant planet in our solar system. Neptune, another gas giant, was formed closer to the Sun but migrated to its current position further away. Neptune is the smallest of the gas giants, although it has a greater mass than Uranus. The atmosphere of Neptune is made of hydrogen, helium, and some methane. The methane absorbs red light, making the planet appear to be blue. Its atmosphere also contains icy clouds and the fastest winds in the entire solar system. Neptune has six thin rings made up of ice particles and dust. Neptune has 14 moons, one being Triton, a frozen moon spewing nitrogen ice and is the coldest world in the solar system. Neptune is an ice giant, meaning that it is composed of a gas surface similar to the gas giants, but its interior is composed of mainly ice and rocks. Since Neptune is so far from the Sun, it gets its energy from its inner core rather than from the Sun. Thus, it is the coldest planet in the Solar System.
