                <h3>Deep Space Atomic Clock</h3>

                <p>A huge part of discoveries, unlocking more doors and gathering new information comes from experimenting. One of the next experiments or "phases" in NASA's plans is the use of atomic clocks for space missions. NASA has already sent out one of these clocks into Orbit already, and if this is successfully, it could change the way humans explore space in the future. The Deep Space Atomic Clock is an enhanced version of atomic clocks used both here on Earth and the clocks that exist on satellites to give us our GPS signals. The purpose of this new atomic clock is to make spacecraft navigation far away in space more autonomous. In other words, scientists hope that this will allow spacecrafts to travel all on their own without any help and guidance from Earth. Currently, astronomers already use clocks to navigate through space. The way this works is by sending a signal to the spacecraft which would be sent back to earth from the spacecraft. By measuring the time of the signal delay, scientists can determine the distance the spacecraft is away from Earth. By repeatedly performing these calculations, the spacecrafts speed and trajectory can be calculated as well. When we are talking about space travel, the distances are enormous. To figure out specific locations within a small margin of error, very accurate clocks are needed - ones that can measure billionths of a second, and clocks that are stable in the sense that the value of 1 unit of measurement doesn't slowly become longer than it used to. This Deep Space Atomic Clock is powered by mercury atoms compared to quarts crystals used in normal clocks, and by doing this, it would take a total of about 10 million years for this clock to be off by 1 second, according to NASA. The clock was sent out to Orbit on June 24, 2019, and since then scientists have begun to test how accurate the clock is and how long the clock can stay accurate for.
